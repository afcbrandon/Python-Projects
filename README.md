# Basic Python Projects
These are basic projects created as part of the python course at The Tech Academy. They use libraries like tkinter and sqlite3. I also did several projects with Django and will provide a link below.


 
 ##  Projects
 - [Checkbook](https://github.com/afcbrandon/checkbook)
    - A simple website using Django that allows different users to pull up their account, check the balance of their account, view previous transactions, and add new transactions to their account. 
    - All transaction and account information is stored in a database.
    - [Recent files transfer](https://github.com/afcbrandon/Python-Projects/tree/main/app_recent_file_transfer)
    - A gui to transfer files from one directory to another if they are new.
